1. Type "make" to build.  (Type "make clean" first if you already compiled and want to recompile from scratch.)

2. Run trace reader:

   To run without throttling output:
   ./sim 256 32 4 gcc_trace.txt

   To run with throttling (via "less"):
   ./sim 256 32 4 gcc_trace.txt | less

3. Run for 8 validation tests

./sim 16 8 1 val_trace_gcc1 >results/res1.txt
diff -iw results/res1.txt validation/val1.txt

./sim 16 8 2 val_trace_gcc1
./sim 60 15 3 val_trace_gcc1

./sim 64 16 8 val_trace_gcc1
./sim 64 16 4 val_trace_perl1
./sim 128 16 5 val_trace_perl1
./sim 256 64 5 val_trace_perl1
./sim 512 64 7 val_trace_perl1
